 *       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
 *       (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
 *  
 *       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
 *       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
 *       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
 *       the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
 *  
 *       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
 *       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

 *       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
 *       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
 *       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
 *       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
 *       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

 *  
 *       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
 *       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
 *       subsequently incorporated within the Work. 
 *  
 *    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
 *       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
 *       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
 *       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
 *       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
 *       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 
 *  
 *    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

 *       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
 *       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
 *       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
 *       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
 *       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
 *       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
 *       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
 *       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
 *       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
 *       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
 *       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
 *       as of the date such litigation is filed. 
 *  
 *    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
 *       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
 *       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
 *       meet the following conditions: 
 *  
 *       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
 *           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 
 *  
 *       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
 *           stating that You changed the files; and 
 *  
 *       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
 *           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
 *           the Derivative Works; and 
 *  
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
 *           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
 *           as modifying the License. 
 *  
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
 *       the conditions stated in this License. 
 *  
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
 *  
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
 *  
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
 *  
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
 *  
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. 
 *  
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 *
